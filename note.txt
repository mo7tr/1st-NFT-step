git clone https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine.git

in hashlips folder npm install => install hashlips

Move layers in layers folders

set config.js

once set use node index.js => generate art collection

node utils/rarity.js => give the details of every layers in quantity/percentage terms (using _metadata.json freshly generated in build/json directory)

upload picture folder on server (pinata for exemple)

copy CID from pinata

replace in config.js the base URI with the CID

node utils/update_info.js to update info in all json files

then publish erc721 minting sc with ifps json uri for each new nft of the collection,
owner must set a minimum price for minting before minting start

Contract can be pusblished directly using remix

advice: use goerli testnet, looks like rinkeby testnet not working anymore with opensea when i used it?

Goerli pow faucet: https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/

MINT!

see your freshly minted NFT on opensea :)
